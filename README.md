- Toll rules and acquirer/plaza info were fetched.
- Final transaction message was produced for error tracking.

Let's continue breaking down the next set of logs step by step:

---

### **1. TagStateHistory Saved to DB**
```
Sep 18, 2025 @ 14:03:32.783	className=TagStateHistoryMasterRepository, methodName=save, group=DB, Time elapsed=16 ms
```
- The `TagStateHistory` entity was **persisted to the database**.
- Took **16 ms** to complete.

---

### **2. Manage Tag Operations Request Created**

```
- A **request to manage tag operations** is being prepared.
- Operation: `ADD` the tag with ID `34161FJ820929E40071FODR3`
- Exception code `01` likely indicates a **"Tag Not Found"** or similar error.

---

### **3. External API Call to Middleware**
```
Sep 18, 2025 @ 14:03:32.783	url : http://middleware-banktest-automation.eks-mwite1/genericMock2/Svs-IssuerNPCI/reqMngException, method : POST, requestBody : ManageTagOperationsData(...)
```
- A **POST request** is made to a middleware service (`Svs-IssuerNPCI`) to handle the tag exception.
- This is likely a **mock or test environment** (`banktest-automation`) used for simulating NPCI interactions.

---

### **4. Kafka Message for TagStateHistory (Again)**
```
Sep 18, 2025 @ 14:03:32.778	TagStateHistory Entity with messageKey : 680845213, topic : fastag_issuer_staging_fastag-issuer-preprocess-tag-state-history
```
- Confirms that the `TagStateHistory` entity is being sent to Kafka again.
- Possibly a **redundant or retry** message.

---

### **5. Kafka Producer Event for TagStateHistory**

```
- Logs the **update event** for the `TagStateHistory` entity.
- Confirms the tag was marked as `BLACKLISTED` due to NPCI state change.
- Metadata includes:
  - `npci_state_action=1`
  - `npci_state=BLACKLISTED`
  - `comment=Tag Not Found`
  - `source=ONLINE_TOLL_TXN`

---

### üîç **Summary of This Flow**
- After identifying the tag as invalid, the system:
  1. **Saved** the tag state change to DB.
  2. **Created a request** to handle the tag exception via middleware.
  3. **Sent Kafka messages** to notify other systems of the tag state change.
  4. **Logged the update** to the tag state history.

Thanks for sharing the next part of the logs. Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **1. Kafka Consumer Triggered**
```
Sep 18, 2025 @ 14:03:32.805	[KafkaListenerAspect] consumer name : consume_switch_transaction_record , appId: IssuerSwitch
```
- A Kafka consumer named `consume_switch_transaction_record` in the application `IssuerSwitch` has been triggered.
- This consumer is responsible for processing **switch transaction records**.

---

### **2. Kafka Message Consumed**
```
Sep 18, 2025 @ 14:03:32.806	[SwitchTransactionConsumer.consumeSwitchTransactionRecord] Consumed message is TransactionRecordKafkaPayload(...)
```
- The consumer has received a **transaction record payload**.
- This includes both:
  - `TransactionData` (original transaction info)
  - `insertedTransaction` (DB-persisted transaction)
- The message came from topic `fastag_issuer_staging_npci_error_code_transaction_records`, partition 3, offset 10.

---

### **3. Exception During Tag Validation**
```
Sep 18, 2025 @ 14:03:32.808	[insertNpciSubErrorCodeInTxnMeta.validateTxnOnClosedTag] Exception occurred ... Exception java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.paytm.issuance.commons.db.entity.Tag.getIssuanceStatus()" because "tagMetaData" is null
```
- While validating the transaction against **closed tags**, a `NullPointerException` occurred.
- The code tried to access `getIssuanceStatus()` on a `Tag` object, but `tagMetaData` was `null`.

---

### **4. Same Exception in Another Method**
```
Sep 18, 2025 @ 14:03:32.808	[insertNpciSubErrorCodeInTxnMeta.validateClosedTags] Exception occurred ... Exception java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.paytm.issuance.commons.db.entity.Tag.getIssuanceStatus()" because "tagMetaData" is null
```
- The same `NullPointerException` is logged again, this time from a broader method `validateClosedTags`.
- This confirms that **tag metadata was missing**, likely because the tag was not found in the DB earlier (as seen in previous logs).

---

### üîç **Root Cause Summary**
- The system attempted to **validate the tag's issuance status**, but `tagMetaData` was `null`.
- This happened because the tag `34161FJ820929E40071FODR3` was **not found in the database**, and hence no metadata was available.
- The system should ideally have a **null check** before calling methods on `tagMetaData`.

---

### ‚úÖ **What Happened So Far**
1. Transaction was consumed and processed.
2. Tag was not found ‚Üí marked as BLACKLISTED.
3. Tag state history was created and sent to Kafka.
4. Middleware was notified of the tag exception.
5. While validating the tag's status post-insertion, a `NullPointerException` occurred due to missing metadata.

Thanks for continuing to share the logs. Here's a breakdown of the **latest set of exceptions**, which all stem from the same root issue:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pattern in All Exceptions**
Each exception is a `**NullPointerException**` caused by trying to access a method on a `null` object:

```java
Cannot invoke "com.paytm.issuance.commons.db.entity.Tag.getXYZ()" because "tagMetaData" is null
```

---

### üîç **Detailed Breakdown of Each Exception**

#### 1. **`validateTxnOnClosedTag`**
```
Exception: Cannot invoke "Tag.getIssuanceStatus()" because "tagMetaData" is null
```
- This method likely checks if the tag is **closed or inactive**.
- It fails because `tagMetaData` (which should contain the `Tag` entity) is `null`.

---

#### 2. **`validateClosedTags`**
- Same root cause as above.
- This method might be a wrapper or higher-level validator that calls `validateTxnOnClosedTag`.

---

#### 3. **`blkLstTxn`**
```
Exception: Cannot invoke "Tag.getNpciStateUpdateTime()" because "tagMetaData" is null
```
- This method probably checks if the tag was **blacklisted recently**.
- Again, it fails due to missing `tagMetaData`.

---

#### 4. **`validateUnRegisteredTags`**
```
Exception: Cannot invoke "Tag.getInventoryStatus()" because "tagMetaData" is null
```
- This method likely checks if the tag is **registered in the system**.
- Since the tag was not found in DB, `tagMetaData` is `null`.

---

#### 5. **`isTagExempted`**
```
Exception: Cannot invoke "Tag.getTagNpciStateExempt()" because "tagMetaData" is null
```
- This method checks if the tag is **exempted from NPCI state validation**.
- Again, fails due to `null` metadata.

---

### üß† **Root Cause**
All these exceptions are caused by the **absence of tag metadata** (`tagMetaData == null`), which was already evident earlier when the system:
- Could not find the tag in DB.
- Marked it as BLACKLISTED.
- Created a `TagStateHistory` entry.

---

### ‚úÖ **Recommended Fix**
To prevent these exceptions:

#### üîí Add Null Checks Before Accessing `tagMetaData`
```java
if (tagMetaData != null) {
    tagMetaData.getIssuanceStatus();
    // other logic
} else {
    log.warn("tagMetaData is null for tagId: {}", transactionData.getTagId());
    // optionally set default behavior or skip validation
}
```

#### üß™ Optional: Fallback Logic
If `tagMetaData` is null:
- Skip validations that depend on it.
- Or, mark the transaction with a specific error code like `TAG_NOT_FOUND`.

Thanks for sharing the continuation of the logs. Let's break this part down and summarize what‚Äôs happening:

---

### üß© **1. Exception: `tagAlreadyInLowBalance`**
```
[insertNpciSubErrorCodeInTxnMeta.tagAlreadyInLowBalance] Exception ... Cannot invoke "Tag.getNpciStateUpdateTime()" because "tagMetaData" is null
```
- This method likely checks if the tag was already in a **low balance or restricted state**.
- Again, it fails due to `tagMetaData == null`.

---

### üß© **2. DB Query: `findByTagIdAndReaderTimeGreaterThanAndReaderTimeLessThan`**
```
className=TransactionMasterRepository, methodName=findByTagIdAndReaderTimeGreaterThanAndReaderTimeLessThan, group=DB, Time elapsed=6 ms
```
- This query fetches **transactions for the same tag** within a **time window**.
- Possibly used to check for **duplicate or recent transactions**.

---

### üß© **3. DB Query: `findByTagIdAndReaderTimeGreaterThanAndReaderTimeLessThanAndPlazaId`**
```
methodName=findByTagIdAndReaderTimeGreaterThanAndReaderTimeLessThanAndPlazaId, Time elapsed=5 ms
```
- Similar to the previous query, but also filters by **plaza ID**.
- Helps narrow down to transactions at the same toll plaza.

---

### üß© **4. Exception Code Logged**
```
[insertSubErrorCodeInTagMeta] Exceptions:{054}
```
- Exception code `054` is being logged.
- This likely maps to a specific **NPCI sub-error code**, possibly indicating **"Tag Not Found"**, **"Invalid Tag"**, or **"Tag Blacklisted"**.

---

### üß© **5. DB Query: `findByTagIdAndReaderTimeAndPlazaIdAndLaneDir`**
```
methodName=findByTagIdAndReaderTimeAndPlazaIdAndLaneDir, Time elapsed=4 ms
```
- Fetches a transaction using **tag ID**, **reader time**, **plaza ID**, and **lane direction**.
- Likely used to **confirm uniqueness** or **fetch related transaction**.

---

### ‚úÖ **6. DB Update: `updateAllNpciErrorCodeInTxnMeta`**
```
methodName=updateAllNpciErrorCodeInTxnMeta, Time elapsed=9 ms
```
- This method **updates the transaction metadata** with the **NPCI error code** (e.g., `054`).
- Ensures the transaction reflects the correct **failure reason** in the DB.

---

### üîç **Summary of This Log Segment**
| Step | Action | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Multiple validations attempted on `tagMetaData` | All failed due to `null` |
| 2 | Several DB queries run to fetch related transactions | Completed successfully |
| 3 | Exception code `054` identified | Logged for tracking |
| 4 | Transaction metadata updated with error code | DB update successful |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Next Steps / Suggestions**
- ‚úÖ **Code Fix**: Add null checks before accessing `tagMetaData` in all validation methods.
- üß™ **Testing**: Ensure test cases cover scenarios where tag is not found in DB.
- üìä **Monitoring**: Consider alerting or logging such `null` tag cases more clearly for faste

Thanks for sharing the final part of the log sequence. Let‚Äôs walk through this segment and summarize the **final steps** of the transaction lifecycle:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Rejection Code & Wallet Status Update**
```
className=TransactionMasterRepository, methodName=updateRejectionCodeAndWalletStatusOnTxn, group=DB, Time elapsed=9 ms
```
- The transaction is updated in the DB with:
  - A **rejection code** (likely `052` or `TAGID_DOESNT_EXIST`)
  - A **wallet status** (possibly `null` or `FAILED`)
- This marks the transaction as **rejected** due to tag issues.

---

### üì§ **2. Kafka Message: Transaction Entity**
```
Transaction Entity with messageKey : 2416427427, topic : fastag_issuer_staging_fastag-issuer-preprocess-transaction
```
- The updated transaction is sent to Kafka for **further downstream processing**.
- Topic: `fastag_issuer_staging_fastag-issuer-preprocess-transaction`

---

### üßæ **3. Kafka Producer Event**
```
KafkaProducerEvent(payload=2416427427, type=Transaction), topic is fastag_issuer_staging_fastag-issuer-preprocess-transaction
```
- Confirms the Kafka message was successfully produced with the transaction ID as the key.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **4. Start of Rejection Code Update**
```
[Start] [update rejection code], npci msg id: ACQ000011894208925
```
- Marks the beginning of the **rejection code update process** for this transaction.

---

### üì¶ **5. Response Pay Message Produced**
```
[TransactionProducer.produce] message is RespPay(...) topic is fastag_issuer_staging_resp_pay_staging
```
- A **`RespPay` message** is produced to Kafka.
- This is the **response to NPCI** indicating the transaction result.
- Key details:
  - `txnId`: `005582957135`
  - `result`: `ACCEPTED` (possibly a placeholder)
  - `errCode`: `052` (likely means **TAGID_DOESNT_EXIST**)
  - `settAmount`: `30.00` (amount attempted)

---

### ‚ùå **6. Validation Result**
```
Validation result for inserted transaction id: 2416427427 ... Error message: TAGID_DOESNT_EXST
```
- Confirms the transaction failed validation due to **missing tag ID** in the system.

---

### üîç **7. TagStateHistory Lookup**
```
methodName=findById, Time elapsed=60 ms
```
- The system fetched the `TagStateHistory` record (probably to confirm the BLACKLISTED status).

---

### üåê **8. Middleware Response for Tag Exception**
```
Response [Manage tag operations]: RespMngException(result=SUCCESS, respCode=000, ...)
```
- Middleware responded **successfully** to the earlier tag exception request.
- The tag operation (`ADD`) was accepted with `errCode=000`.

---

### ‚úÖ **Final Summary of the Transaction Lifecycle**

| Step | Action | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| ‚úÖ Kafka message consumed | Transaction received | Tag not found in DB |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Tag validation | Multiple `NullPointerException`s | Due to `tagMetaData == null` |
| üö´ Tag marked BLACKLISTED | `TagStateHistory` created | Sent to Kafka |
| üì§ Middleware notified | Tag exception handled | Response: `SUCCESS` |
| ‚ùå Transaction validation failed | Error: `TAGID_DOESNT_EXIST` | Rejection code `052` |
| üõ†Ô∏è DB updated | Rejection code + wallet status | Transaction marked failed |
| üì¶ Kafka messages produced | `Transaction` + `RespPay` | Sent to downstream systems |

---

```
[TransactionProducer.produceTransactionMessage] message is TransactionKafkaPayload(transaction=..., transactionStatus=REJECTED, rejectionDesc=Transaction tag ID does not exist in our system, rejectionCode=152)
```
- A **Kafka message** is produced with the **final rejected transaction**.
- Rejection details:
  - **Code**: `152`
  - **Description**: `"Transaction tag ID does not exist in our system"`

---

### üì• **6. Kafka Consumer Triggered**
```
[KafkaListenerAspect] consumer name : consumer_switch_transaction , appId: IssuerSwitch
```
- The `consumer_switch_transaction` Kafka listener is triggered to process the rejected transaction.

---

### üì¶ **7. Kafka Message Consumed**
```
[SwitchTransactionConsumer.consumerSwitchTransaction] Consumed message is TransactionKafkaPayload(...)
```
- The rejected transaction is consumed by the `SwitchTransactionConsumer`.
- This may trigger further downstream actions like:
  - Logging

Thanks for sharing the final log entries. Here's a breakdown of the **last phase** of the transaction lifecycle, which involves **NPCI response handling** and **final Kafka propagation**:

---

### üßæ **1. NPCI Response Consumed**
```
[NPCIResponseConsumer.consume] Consumed message is {"res_type_enum":"RESPPAY","response_data":"{\"ts\":\"2025-09-18T14:03:33\",\"reference_id\":2416427427,\"http_code\":\"202\"}"}
